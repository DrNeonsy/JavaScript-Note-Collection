Comments are a way to add information to your code. They are used to explain the code and make it easier to understand. This of course means, that whatever you are writing in a comment will not be executed by the browser, or whereever you run your code.

## Single-line comments

Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`) and continue until the end of the line.

They are usually used to explain a single line of code or to disable a line of code temporarily.

:::note
Try **`not to`**`make it a habbit` to disable code with comments if you are not going to use that specific line of code *ever* again. It would be better to remove unused code. 
:::

```js title="Single-line comment"
thisIsCode(); // This is a single-line comment explaining that what you see on the left is theoretically a function call.
```

## Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk (`/*`) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash (`*/`).

They are usually used to explain a block of code or to disable a block of code temporarily. They can also be used to add documentation to your code, which will come more important later on.

```js title="Multi-line comment"

/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 * It can contain multiple lines.
 */

thisIsCode();
```

## Disabling code

To disable a line of code, or multiple lines, you can just add a comment at the beginning of the line or around a block of code.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Normal Code">
    ```js title="Comments.js"
    doSomething();

    thisIsTotally();
        valid();
            code();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Single Line">
    ```js title="Comments.js"
    // doSomething();

    thisIsTotally();
        valid();
            code();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Multi Line">
    ```js title="Comments.js"
    doSomething();

    /*thisIsTotally();
        valid();
            code(); */
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next

This is the most rudementary thing you can learn when starting out. I thought it would be a good idea to explain it, because JavaScript in comparison to Python has two ways to comment your code.

:::note
If you've read my Python Collection, you might've notice my use of `"""` for multi-line comments. That is actually meant for `docblocks` in Python, which are used to add documentation to your code.

Next up is how to display / print something to the console.
